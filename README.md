# 📝 Simple Text Editor

This project was made to **get back into coding** after a long break.  
I started with a **small project** to ease back into programming. 🚀

It is a **basic text editor** built with Python and Tkinter.  
You can:
- 🆕 Create new `.txt` files
- 📂 Open existing `.txt` files
- 💾 Save your work

## How to Run
1. Make sure **Python 3** is installed 🐍
2. Run `TEXTEDITORAPP.py`  
3. The text editor window will open ✨
